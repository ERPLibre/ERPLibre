# Social networks

Feeds and posting built into the TODO CLI, beside the mail client and on the
same principles: a local cache that answers offline, a secret that lives in
the vault and never in a file, and nothing that leaves the machine except
what you ask to send.

Every `Social > ...` path below is shorthand for
`TODO > [3] Assistant > [3] Social networks > ...`.


## What it is
`TODO > Assistant > Social networks` reads the feeds of an account and
publishes to it, from the terminal, next to the mail client and on the same
principles: a local cache that answers offline, a secret that lives in the
vault and never in a file, and nothing that leaves the machine except what
you ask to send.

It is a SEPARATE screen from the mail client, not a tab inside it. A feed has
no folders, no growing UIDs and no drafts, and the gestures that matter are
not the same ones.

## The three platforms, and what each really allows

|  | Read the feed | Publish |
|---|---|---|
| Mastodon | yes | yes |
| Bluesky | yes | yes |
| LinkedIn | **no** | yes |

**A LinkedIn feed stays empty, by construction.** Retrieving a member's feed
needs an authorisation granted to a few chosen developers, and the activity
feed API is deprecated; only publishing is self-serve. The tree says so under
such an account instead of showing an empty node, which would read like a
fetch that never happened.

All three are implemented. LinkedIn publishes and does not read: its
transport refuses a feed WITHOUT calling, since the limit is known in advance
and calling would make it look like a breakdown of the day.

The two implemented ones authenticate differently, and it shows. Mastodon
takes a token you paste, valid until you revoke it. Bluesky opens a SESSION
from an app password and returns two tokens: a short access one and a durable
refresh one. The access token expires mid-session, the service names that
error, and the client refreshes instead of asking for the password again —
asking would be the mistake that error name exists to prevent.

## Adding an account

No client identifier ships with the repository: it would be public from the
first clone. Each platform offers a path where you obtain your own token.

| Platform | Where the token comes from |
|---|---|
| Mastodon | Preferences > Development > New application, scopes `read` and `write` |
| Bluesky | an app password created in the settings — never the account password |
| LinkedIn | an application you register, which LinkedIn approves |

The token goes into the vault, exactly like a mail password, and
`~/.erplibre/social/accounts.json` keeps only a reference to it. The file is
readable and repairable without being a place where a leak would hurt.

## The screen

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `r` / `R` | fetch the current account / every account |
| `c` | write a post |
| `a` | reply to the post under the cursor |
| `s` / `u` | mark the post read / unread |
| `M` | mark the whole feed read |
| `q` | quit |

## Fetching, and why a pass stops

A pass resumes from an opaque cursor the cache keeps, and paging descends
towards the past. It stops when the instance announces no more, or after five
pages — without that ceiling, a first pass on an old account would drag years
of feed back for a screen that shows only the top.

While the ceiling keeps interrupting the descent, the cursor makes the next
pass resume where it stopped, and new posts at the top wait for the descent
to finish. Once the instance stops announcing a next page, the cursor is
cleared and the following pass starts from the top again.

## Publishing twice is what the client refuses

The failure that matters when sending is not a refusal, it is silence: the
instance posts the message and the answer never arrives, leaving you unable
to tell which world you are in.

Every publication therefore carries an idempotency key, and the compose
screen keeps its own key as long as it is open. A send that fails leaves the
screen open with its text, so pressing send again replays the same key — and
the instance returns the post already created instead of creating a second
one. That is what makes the button safe to press twice.

On Bluesky there is no key to send: publishing means WRITING A RECORD at an
address the client chooses, and rewriting the same address replaces instead
of adding. The guarantee is the same, the mechanism is not — the client keeps
the address exactly as it keeps a key, and a fresh one each try would publish
twice. That protocol carries no visibility either: the field is accepted so
the caller need not tell the networks apart, and ignored, since pretending to
honour it would suggest a privacy that does not exist.

LinkedIn offers NEITHER: two identical requests make two publications, and
nothing can prevent it. So when the answer is lost the client does not retry
— it says it does not know, and asks you to check before sending again. That
is a third answer beside a refusal you correct and a breakdown you retry, and
the compose screen words it differently for that reason.

A refusal is told apart from a breakdown: a service saying no to an empty or
over-long post will not change its mind, while a broken gateway will. The
length allowed is asked of a Mastodon instance, which raises or lowers it; on
Bluesky it is the protocol's own 300 and on LinkedIn 3000, with nothing to
ask in either case.

## The cache

One SQLite per account under `~/.erplibre/social/<account>/`, in 0700 with
the database in 0600, sealable exactly like the mail cache. What is sealed:
the author, the display name, the text, the URI and the attachment
descriptions — that is who you read and what you read. What stays clear: the
date, because sorting ten thousand posts must not decrypt a row apiece.

A post's identifier is a STRING the platform chooses — a snowflake counter on
one, an `at://` URI on another — so the key is the pair feed plus identifier,
never a number this cache invented.
