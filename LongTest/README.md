# LongTest — tests that create real machines

These are not unit tests. They create virtual machines, install systems on
them, and take hours. They live here and **not** in `test/`, which the unit
runner sweeps: `./script/test/run_unit_test.sh` must stay runnable in seconds
on any machine, including one without virtualisation.

Run them from the menu — `TODO › Execute › Test › Long tests` — or directly.

## deep_proxmox.py — how deep does Proxmox-in-Proxmox go?

The practicable nesting depth cannot be deduced, only measured — and one
measurement is not a measurement.

A manual look at one fourth-level VM found a guest **36 times slower than real
time** (583 seconds of wall clock for 16 seconds of guest time, each ACPI line
taking a second) and then a frozen kernel: identical RIP across three samples
two minutes apart, and **not one byte written** to disk.

Running this script **refuted the conclusion drawn from it**. Its own
fourth-level VM — 2 vCPU where the manual one had 12 — booted, installed, and
wrote gigabytes. What looked like a nesting ceiling was a *parallelism*
ceiling under nesting. That is exactly what the algorithm caps, and this is
how it stopped being a guess.

Which is the point of the script: a number obtained once, on one machine, in
one chain, is an anecdote.

```
./LongTest/deep_proxmox.py --depth 10 --dry-run   # the plan, nothing created
./LongTest/deep_proxmox.py --depth 10             # hours
./LongTest/deep_proxmox.py --detruire             # undo it
```

The descent is **uniform**. Every level, the first included, goes through the
same six steps: create, wait for ssh, install Proxmox, reboot and check the
kernel, bring pmxcfs back up, check the storage. Only creation differs —
libvirt locally, `qm` afterwards.

It sends **our** `install_proxmox.sh` over scp instead of letting the VM clone
the repository: it is our code we want to exercise, and the remote is often
behind the checkout — a fix absent from the remote made the same defect "come
back" on three VMs in a row.

### The resource algorithm — sized from the bottom up

The first version handed down whatever the parent could spare, and a real
descent showed what that costs. Level 4 ended up with 44 GB of memory and
2 vCPU **on a host that had 2** — a hundred percent overcommit, at every
level, with the hypervisor itself to serve on top. Its install ran past two
and a half hours against thirteen minutes for level 3, and extrapolating that
ratio gave five years for the tenth.

So the direction is reversed. The deepest level gets what a test Proxmox
actually asks for — 4 GB of memory, 25 GB of disk, 2 vCPU — and every parent
above it adds its own overhead and nothing else: one vCPU, 2 GiB, 10 GB. A
ten-level descent therefore asks its first level for 11 vCPU, 22 GB and
115 GB, where handing resources down wanted 50 GB of memory for the same
depth.

Three budgets can bound the depth, and `script/proxmox/nesting.py` names the
one that ran out:

* **memory** — every level must run its own daemons (`pve-cluster`,
  `pvestatd`, `pvedaemon`, `pveproxy`) *and* hold its child;
* **disk** — the child's disk lives *inside* the parent's, which must also
  hold its own system;
* **processor** — each level wants one vCPU more than its child, so ten levels
  ask eleven of the first. Half the physical cores is the ceiling: the
  orchestrator runs on that machine too.

That third budget is measured, not assumed. Twelve vCPU at the fourth level
froze the guest kernel in early boot — same instruction pointer at three
readings two minutes apart — while two progressed. The number was not the
culprit: that VM had twelve vCPU on a host with two, six times wider than its
own machine. Overcommit freezes, not the twelve.

Memory is not the lever. On that same manual VM, dropping it from 9 GB to 2 GB
moved nothing — it stopped after reading the same 32 MiB, which is simply the
size of the boot files.

The plan is printed **before** anything is created, and the script never
promises a depth it knows will not fit — better to announce six levels and
reach six than to promise ten and die at the seventh without knowing why.
