# TODO

## Deb installation
devops_erplibre need sshpass

## Simplify push tag
For RELEASE.md, replace next value by a script to select all remote by manifest file.
Actually, need to push manually all different remote.
> ./.venv/repo forall -pc "git push ERPLibre --tags"

## Funding
- Add funding for MathBenTech and TechnoLibre

## Improve repo init usage

## Improve repo sync usage
- Test repo sync with argument -d
- Test repo sync with argument -t SMART_TAG, like tag ERPLibre/v1.0.0
