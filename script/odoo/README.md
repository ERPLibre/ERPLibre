# Odoo instance tools

| File | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `update_module.py` | updates installed modules of an instance run by systemd: stop, back up, update, restart, check |
| `log_check.py` | reads the journal of an instance: tracebacks, errors, refused SQL queries, mail sending failures, to review (read-only) |
| `mail_retry.py` | lists the failed outgoing mails of an instance (read-only), then requeues the chosen ones through the Odoo shell |
| `warmup_http.py` | wakes the registry up as soon as the server listens; launched by `run.sh` |
| `migration/` | migration tools, see [migration/README.md](migration/README.md) |

## update_module.py

```bash
./script/odoo/update_module.py --module my_module_a --dry-run
sudo ./script/odoo/update_module.py --module 'my_module_*' --db demo_db
```

It is also reachable from `make todo`: `Execute > Production`, which runs
the simulation first and asks before the real run.

What it does, in order:

1. **Detection, nothing stopped.** The unit is `--service`, else the
   `erplibre…`/`odoo…` unit whose `WorkingDirectory` is this checkout, else
   the only active one. Its account, directory, command line and
   environment come from `systemctl show`. The Odoo configuration, the
   database (`--db`, else `-d` of the unit, else `db_name`), the HTTP port
   and the modules (patterns expanded over `addons_path`, only folders with
   a `__manifest__.py`) are deduced from them. Anything missing refuses
   with code 2.
2. **Root and lock.** Root is required (except `--dry-run`); one lock per
   database, shared with the backup tool, code 75 when another update or
   backup holds it.
3. **Stop.** The state before is read from `ActiveState`; without an
   answer from systemctl nothing is stopped (code 2). After `systemctl
   stop`, the unit must be `inactive` or `failed` (not `deactivating`).
   If the port still answers, or an Odoo process runs on the same database
   outside the unit, the update is refused unless `--force`.
4. **Backup** (unless `--no-backup`), after the stop so that it is
   consistent: the verified backup of
   [script/database/odoo_backup.py](../database/README.md), called while
   the update already holds the database lock. It is written to
   `--backup-dest/<db>/` (default `/var/backups/erplibre`) and recorded in
   `--state-dir` (default `/var/lib/erplibre-backup`). Before anything is
   stopped, the detection checks that the unit's account can write there
   (missing folders are created for it), that the database can be read and
   that there is enough disk space; otherwise it refuses with code 2. It
   neither copies off-site nor applies retention: the scheduled backup
   does.
5. **Update**: the unit's command line followed by `-c CONFIG -d DB -u
   MODULES --stop-after-init --no-http --workers=0 --max-cron-threads=0`,
   as the unit's account — the repeated `-c` keeps the update on the file
   the detection and the backup read (`--odoo-conf` included). It fails
   on a non-zero code, on `--timeout`, or on an
   `ERROR`/`CRITICAL` record in its output or in what was appended to the
   configured `logfile`. A record is the header line and its continuation
   lines (a traceback); the report groups tracebacks by their final
   exception, like `log_check.py`. `--ignore-error REGEX`, searched in the
   header line and in the final exception, excludes known records.
6. **Restart**, if the unit was running: wait for `active` and the port
   (`--start-wait`), one HTTP request, then the unit's journal and the
   `logfile` are read since the start.

The unit is never modified: the tool only reads it and runs `systemctl
stop` / `start`. Whatever happens after the stop — failure, exception,
Ctrl-C, SIGTERM — a unit that was running is restarted. Nothing is
restored: the tool does not replace the code; the backup is there for a
restore decided by a person.

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | success (or simulation) |
| 1 | update failed, service restarted |
| 2 | refused before anything was stopped |
| 75 | another update or backup of this database is running |
| 130 | interrupted, service restarted |

The update log goes to `--log-dir` (default `/var/log/erplibre`, falling
back to the temporary directory).

## log_check.py

```bash
./script/odoo/log_check.py --since-last
./script/odoo/log_check.py --last 6
./script/odoo/log_check.py --since "2026-03-01 08:00" --until "2026-03-01 12:00"
./script/odoo/log_check.py --by-hour --days 7
./script/odoo/log_check.py --file /var/log/odoo/odoo.log --json
```

**Source.** The unit is `--service`, else detected like `update_module.py`.
When its configuration sets a `logfile`, Odoo writes there and that file is
read; otherwise `journalctl -u UNIT -o short-iso`, streamed with an overall
`--timeout`. `--file` reads a given file without a unit. When the account
cannot read the configuration, a `--logfile` on ExecStart is read if there
is one, otherwise the journal; a journal read that yields no Odoo record then
refuses (code 2, advising sudo) instead of reporting nothing to review.

**Window.** `--since-last` resumes after the last read: the journal cursor
(`--after-cursor`), or the byte offset of a file that kept its inode and did
not shrink (otherwise it is read from the start, and the report says so);
the first run reads the last 24 h. `--last HOURS`, `--since`/`--until`
(local time) and `--by-hour --days N` (default 7, adds the hour × day
matrix) never touch the state. Without a window option: the last 24 h.

**State.** `--state-dir/<unit>.json` (default `/var/lib/erplibre-logcheck`),
written only after a complete and successful read, through a temporary file
and a rename; a state that is a symbolic link is neither read nor replaced.
When the folder is not writable the report is still printed and says
"position not saved".

**Report.** (1) Python tracebacks grouped by their final exception line,
with count, first and last time and one sample (`--full-trace` shows all of
it); (2) other `ERROR`/`CRITICAL` records grouped by logger and normalised
message; (3) refused SQL queries (`odoo.sql_db: bad query`) by table and
PostgreSQL reason; (4) mail sending failures classified as transient or
PERMANENT with the Odoo setting to check; (5) known noise counted apart:
outdated asset source maps, serialization conflicts that Odoo retries,
outdated VAPID push subscriptions, plus `--ignore REGEX` (searched in the
header line and the final exception, never in traceback frames). Only
`ERROR` and `CRITICAL` are "to review". Times are local. `--json` prints a
summary with stable English keys; `update_module.py` uses the same parser.

It never writes anything but its state file and reads no database. Root is
not required when the account belongs to `systemd-journal` (or `adm`);
otherwise journalctl only shows the account's own messages, which is
detected and reported with code 2 and the advice to use sudo.

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | nothing to review |
| 1 | something to review |
| 2 | could not read (rights, unit, file, options) |
| 130 | interrupted |

## mail_retry.py

```bash
./script/odoo/mail_retry.py --dry-run
sudo ./script/odoo/mail_retry.py
sudo ./script/odoo/mail_retry.py --resend oldest 10 --yes
sudo ./script/odoo/mail_retry.py --resend ids 7404,7405 --yes --json
```

**List, read-only.** One `psql` query as the unit's account, with the
connection settings of its Odoo configuration passed through the
environment and a read-only transaction forced by `PGOPTIONS`: the
`mail.mail` in state `exception` created in the last `--days` (30), oldest
first, with date, subject, recipients masked by default (`j***@example.org`,
a display name reduced to its initial; `--details` shows everything) and the
failure cause, transient or PERMANENT, whose addresses are masked the same
way, in the text as in `--json`. Then totals by subject, cause and
day, and two warnings: a PERMANENT cause fails again until the named setting
is fixed; more than 10 mails with `mail.session.batch.size` unset or above
20 may hit the server's limit of messages per connection.

**Resend, through the ORM.** `--resend all | oldest N | ids LIST` with
`--yes` (without a terminal, nothing is resent without it); on a terminal
without `--resend`, a menu: `[a]ll`, `[o]ldest batch`, `[i]ds`, `[n]one`
(default). `--list` only lists. The unit's `odoo_bin.sh shell` runs as its
account in its working directory with a short script on its standard input:
it re-reads the mails still in `exception`, calls `action_retry()` when the
method exists, else `write({'state': 'outgoing'})`, commits, and prints its
result as JSON. The scheduled action "Mail: Email Queue Manager" then sends
the queue. No SQL write is ever made. `--dry-run` shows the selection and
the exact command and script. Beyond `--timeout`, the shell's whole process
group is stopped; a commit may have happened just before, so the tool says
the outcome is unknown and the list must be read again.

Root is only needed to become the unit's account.

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | no failed mail, or every chosen mail requeued |
| 1 | failed mails listed and not resent, or part of the selection skipped |
| 2 | refused or impossible (detection, rights, psql, no answer from the shell) |
| 130 | interrupted |

### Odoo 12 to 18

| Point | Variation |
|-------|-----------|
| Log line | `date time,ms pid LEVEL db logger: message`, with a trailing `perf_info` from 13; db `?` outside a request; header time in UTC |
| `mail.mail.failure_type` | present in 18; not checked in 12 to 17; read without branching (`to_jsonb(m)->>'failure_type'`), the text decides when it is missing |
| `mail.mail.action_retry()` | checked in 18 only; fallback `write({'state': 'outgoing'})` |
| From filter (`from_filter`) | 15+; named in the sender advice from 15 |
| Alias domains (default from, catchall) | 17+; `mail.default.from` and `mail.catchall.domain` system parameters up to 16 |
| `mail.session.batch.size` | present in 18; not checked in 12 to 14 |
