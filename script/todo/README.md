TODO is an assistant robot to use ERPLibre
Execute it with `./script/todo/todo.py` or `make todo`.

For a new project, copy todo_example.json to private/todo/todo_override.json | private/todo/todo_override_private.json and edit it.

The `mail/` package is the mail client reachable from `Assistant > Mail`:
several IMAP/SMTP accounts, a local cache, and a Textual TUI. See
[../../doc/EMAIL.md](../../doc/EMAIL.md).

## Where the code lives

`todo.py` carries the menus and the general helpers. Everything around a
single subject sits in its own file, and the whole thing is assembled by
mixins on the `TODO` class — one file, one subject, its header states its
boundary.

| File | What it owns |
|------|--------------|
| `todo.py` | the menus, the configuration, the general helpers |
| `qemu_menu.py` | the QEMU/KVM menu, the image catalogue, the statistics |
| `qemu_deploy.py` | deciding then running a deployment |
| `qemu_install.py` | the recipes run inside a VM |
| `qemu_manage.py` | lifecycle, disks, hardware, cleanup, addresses |
| `qemu_access.py` | SSH, tunnels, consoles, Android emulator |
| `proxmox_menu.py` | the same, on a REMOTE Proxmox VE host |

The two deployment forms — libvirt here, Proxmox over there — ask the same
questions, so they share a foundation rather than each holding a copy:

| File | What it owns |
|------|--------------|
| `deploy_form_lib.py` | pure logic (sizes, plan, totals, spec), the shared CSS, the resource-row factory, the progress view |
| `deploy_form_plan.py` | the plan's gestures: overrides, locks, copies, renaming, free values |
| `qemu_deploy_form.py` | what QEMU/KVM adds: desktops, tools, branches, install profiles |
| `proxmox_deploy_form.py` | what Proxmox adds: host, storage, bridge, VMID, address |

A form inherits `PlanMixin` and provides three hooks: which presets each
resource offers, the name a VM would fall back to, and what a lock freezes.
`test_todo_deploy_form_lib.py` fails if a form redefines a gesture the
foundation already carries — that is what keeps the architecture from drifting
back into two copies.
