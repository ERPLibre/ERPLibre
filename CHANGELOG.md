# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com). This project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [Unreleased]

## Added

- A download cache shared by the QEMU VMs of a host, installed from **Deployment › QEMU cache**. Two VMs of the same distribution stop pulling the same hundreds of megabytes twice: a package file is served from disk, while an index is always taken from upstream, so a withdrawn package can never turn into a « failed retrieving file … 404 ». An index is stored all the same and only comes back out when upstream is unreachable, which is what makes an offline deployment possible. Interception is transparent on the bridge, and a deployment form checkbox posts the certificate authority a VM must trust — without it the VM rejects the certificate and every HTTPS download fails. The cache never shrinks by itself: `--status` says what it occupies
- `long_test/qemu_cache.py` measures whether the cache really serves the second VM, and `--hors-ligne` cuts the upstream of the cache service alone to prove a third VM still builds from the stored index

## Changed

- The comment hygiene check reads Go comments, not only `#` ones: `//` outside a string, the raw string between backticks, and `/* … */` blocks

## Fixed

- The « - Default » label appears again at the version and environment menus: both reads asked for a capitalised key the version file never writes, and a missing key returns nothing without a word


## [1.8.0] - 2026-09-04

**Migration notes**

Recreating the virtual environment, the Python interpreter and the package
installer being chosen now. Use the installation guide from tool `make`.
Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 are no longer supported.

## Added

- Deploy ERPLibre VMs with QEMU/KVM from cloud images: Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, AlmaLinux, Rocky, openSUSE, Arch, Linux Mint, and Debian on s390x. Hardware, branch and Odoo version are set per machine
- Proxmox VE as a deployment target, its installation including the reboot it needs
- A QEMU menu: network status and repair, 3D acceleration, a diagnostic report, file recovery from a VM that no longer boots, virt-viewer and a remote desktop tunnel
- An install dashboard and Textual forms: deploy, follow, update, restart or delete a VM without leaving the screen
- A mobile development VM: PyCharm, Android Studio, an Android emulator and an adb tunnel
- A VPN tool, five free technologies from the menu, the secrets in a KeePassXC vault and a diagnosis that names the failing stage
- Automated Odoo migration: the tool drives the whole run, goes back to a step, and repairs what a version bump leaves behind
- Migration review: a verdict per step, smoke tests on every public URL, and a filestore check
- A read-only analysis toolkit for an Odoo database, a backup zip included, with PostgreSQL index advice
- Anonymising a production copy without AI, and duplicating a database neutralised for good
- Development assistants installed inside a VM, and a Git and Shell menu that installs what a checkout needs
- A writing convention for what stays in git, held by a `pre-commit` and a `commit-msg` hook
- `long_test/` — tests that create real machines, nested QEMU and Proxmox included, kept out of the unit runner
- NTFY, Forgejo, a local git server, e-mail from the CLI, and SSH configuration with recursive ProxyJump
- The Python interpreter and the package installer are chosen, through EL_PYTHON_PROVIDER and EL_PIP_PROVIDER
- The OCA generative AI policy, Claude Code agents and commands, and the context an assistant is given, shown from the menu
- Unit tests with a bilingual test plan, navigation telemetry for TODO, and Odoo 18 reading STL files

## Changed

- todo.py split into nine files, one per subject, with a shared base per form
- Every menu entry carries an icon, the menus are grouped into sections, and a countdown prompt gives 15 seconds to decide
- Branch, profile, type and timezone are chosen per VM rather than globally
- Installation covers Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, Arch and openSUSE; repository sync and Poetry run in parallel, quiet unless EL_VERBOSE asks
- Node.js 22 for Capacitor 8, flanker for Odoo 18, CybroOdoo extras opt-in, and a Poetry dependency declinable per architecture
- A VM boots faster and picks the fastest reachable mirror, Canadian pacman mirrors coming first on Arch
- Staging names the files, never `git add -A`
- Enter targets the highest supported Odoo version, and a VM name drops the `latest` segment

## Fixed

- The libvirt network no longer counts as its own collision, no longer leaves a host without network at the next boot, and its state is read in English whatever the locale
- QEMU deployment: sudo says why it needs a password, the `libvirt` group replaces it where it suffices, no host reboots unasked, and an orphan disk no longer blocks a creation
- Migration: the database drop, the account.root view Odoo 17 leaves behind, the pricelists a repair invented, and the assumptions the 13-to-18 run rested on
- Anonymisation respects what a value means, and no longer breaks past the 131 072-byte limit of a single argument
- Installation on Debian 13, Fedora, Ubuntu 26.04 and s390x: apt locks, missing compilers and headers, too little memory, and what a recent SWIG or PROJ needs
- Secrets: the KeePassXC vault opens on a server without tkinter, the forgejo installer stops echoing the password it set, and db_restore validates the master one
- A question is seen before it is answered, and one faulty repository no longer takes a whole batch down
- Three screens that fell over, a shrink that would have filled the disk, and a monitor that binned a VM before being sure
- The unit runner globs the whole directory, where it ran 1131 tests of 3703
- Proxmox no longer aims at the host instead of the VM

## Removed

- Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 support, on every architecture
- The residue check that called a language broken when its `active` is NULL

## Security

- Passwords and tokens are redacted before a command is displayed, logged or reprinted
- The Odoo master password and the KeePass one leave the command line, an environment variable carrying them instead


## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-11

**Migration notes**

Recreating the virtual environment, use installation guide from tool `make`.

## Added

- Odoo 12.0 to 18.0 in a single workspace, switched without reinstalling: the manifests, the configuration and the addons paths follow the version named in `.odoo-version`
- ERPLibre's Python separated from Odoo's — `.venv.erplibre` carries the repository's own tools, `.venv.odoo<version>` the server — so a tool of the repository no longer depends on the interpreter a given Odoo version imposes
- Auto-installation driven from TODO: the menu lays down the environment it needs, Poetry, the Google Repo manifests and the addons included, rather than printing a command to retype
- Migration of an Odoo database and its modules from TODO, `--neutralize` included, with the repair of the mail module that a move from PostgreSQL 17 to 18 leaves behind
- A hardening script for the installation
- The ERPLibre Home mobile application: TODO compiles it, deploys it, renames the software and changes its menu image
- The RobotLibre code generator, with the queue_job channels its configuration needs
- ERPLibre DevOps, and the automation procedure it describes
- The Selenium grid from `selenium_lib.py`: a KeePass vault opened for the run, file downloads, dark mode, video recording and a scenario library
- A performance script measuring the requests per second a website answers
- Deployment: Cloudflare DNS, nginx with a non-interactive certbot, Apache templates matching the nginx ones, and a systemd unit whose working directory is configurable
- The s390x mainframe architecture
- Addons OnlyOffice, Cetmix, OCA automation, OCA shopfloor, and the design-themes repository
- Database backup and erase commands, and a clearer restore naming
- A security check of the Python environment, from the menu
- TODO shows the documentation, downloads a database and helps with code formatting
- Killing an Odoo process by the port it holds, from the menu
- CLAUDE.md and the agent information document, so an assistant reads the repository's conventions instead of guessing them
- A FAQ entry on wkhtmltopdf for recent distributions

## Changed

- Odoo 18.0 becomes the default version of a checkout
- Docker moves to PostgreSQL 18, with the matching client
- The documentation is bilingual, generated by mmg from the `.base.md` sources: a `.md` or `.fr.md` edited directly is lost at the next generation
- The TODO menus are grouped into sections, and the English text serves as the i18n key rather than a code of its own
- The formatting script looks for the changed files in every repository, hidden addons included, and skips a repository that is not installed
- Odoo runs on a custom database, and the menu configures queue_job as well as the SSH forwarding a remote instance needs
- Killing a process by port asks before acting, through an interactive menu
- Neutralising a database goes through Odoo's own `--neutralize`
- LinuxMint 22.3, Ubuntu 25.10, and macOS without Python 3.7
- Odoo 18 dependencies: tldextract, PyYAML, pdfminer.six, and cryptography at its latest version
- A make target runs the unit tests
- The Makefile is split: its commands live in `conf/`, and `Common.Makefile` extends it for a project of one's own

## Fixed

- The documentation accents, and the markdown generation running in parallel
- `git_tool` returns nothing instead of raising where `.git` is absent
- `poetry iscompatible` no longer crashes on a version carrying a letter, an alpha or a release candidate
- pymssql compiles again, and the Odoo 18 requirements leave pyssql out of a production install
- wkhtmltopdf is no longer offered where it does not exist: no package is published for s390x on Ubuntu 25.10
- Selenium: the snap Firefox path, a 60-second timeout when reaching for an element, execution in a private window, and a login that waits for Odoo 18
- The formatting script ignores the files and directories it must not touch
- `db_drop_all` runs its shell command, and the backup processing keeps the permissions of what it writes
- TODO: the first import, the regeneration of `.repo/local_manifests`, the database open dialog, and a missing Odoo version reported instead of a crash
- The code generator: creating a project, extracting a class carrying a selection, and reading a model through the Python 3.11 `ast` module rather than astor
- Docker: the duplicated Odoo 18 build target, and the compose file pinned to an image that works


## [1.6.0] - 2025-04-25

## Added
